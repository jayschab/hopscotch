Hopscotch is meant to make easy a very simple problem. Where I currently work has a number of internal wikis. It is often easiest to point people with questions to the appropriate wiki. However sometimes these pages are very long and is somewhat rude to send people a link and say "about n% down" when Firefox will let you jump straight to any element with an id attribute by putting that a hash '#' and the ID after the URL. (Generically these are known as fragment identifiers. Look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier#Examples for an example and actually follow the link for more examples). 

The only issue with these is making the links. Hopscotch adds an entry to the context menu to let you copy the page jump link to the clipboard for the currently selected element or it's nearest ancestor with an id attribute specified.
